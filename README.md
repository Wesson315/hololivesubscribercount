The 42 members tracked are members of the groups<br>

Hololive - The "main" Japanese branch<br>
Hololive-ID - The Indonesian branch<br>
Hololive-EN - The English branch<br>

##### Currently Missing

**Hololive-CH** - No members of the chinese branch, except for Civia, are currently being tracked due to them exclusively broadcasting on <a href="https://www.bilibili.com">bilibili</a>.<br>

**Holostars** - The japanese male branch of Hololive, called "Holostars", is currently not being tracked. This is due to my laziness and will be addressed in the near future!<br>
